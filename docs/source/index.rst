Welcome to EigenPro's documentation!
===================================

**EigenPro** is a Python library for fast training of kernel models
using primal space projected, preconditioned stochastic gradient descent.
The method applies several stochastic approximations.

It works well with multiple GPUs. But is currently optimized for a single GPU.
It has been tested with 5 million samples and 1 million centers.

It is easy to install, check out the :ref:`installation` instructions.

Check out the :doc:`examples`.
